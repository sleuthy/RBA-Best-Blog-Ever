            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>My first week at Nashville Software School was a complete whirlwind. Even though I had been anticipating the start of NSS's six-month bootcamp for months, I learned quickly that I wouldn't know what I was in for until I arrived.</p>
            <p>The biggest challenge so far? Retraining my brain. Working consistently for hours at a time to learn and apply new concepts is not something my brain has actively been engaged in for quite some time. As a lifelong lover of learning, I came into this program believing I had an edge; I have always thrived in a classroom environment and love the energy that comes from a group of people working through projects/ideas/problems together. Having been mostly self-employed for the past several years, and before that having worked in positions that did not require much active problem-solving, I realized this week that that part of my brain has been turned off, perhaps for years.</p>
            <p>Retraining my brain to absorb highly technical concepts, then apply those concepts in a concrete way, is a task that has been harder than I anticipated. Even as I'm writing this, I'm noticing that my writing skills have taken quite a hit this past week... is my right brain slowly deactivating to make room for a more activated left brain? Or am I just exhausted? (I imagine both.)</p>
            <p> One of my major accomplishments this week? I think I finally understand git and gitHub. Is that possible?</p>
